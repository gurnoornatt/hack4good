# BurnAI API Development Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **API Structure Setup**
   - Created a well-organized directory structure for the API
   - Implemented modular components for models, routes, and utilities
   - Set up proper logging and error handling

2. **Data Models**
   - Defined Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
   - Created models for counties, weather conditions, and burn assessments
   - Implemented proper documentation for all models

3. **API Routes**
   - Created routes for counties and data endpoints
   - Implemented proper error handling and response formatting
   - Added comprehensive documentation for all endpoints

4. **Testing and Documentation**
